# Advent of Code - 2021

My 2021 Advent of Code entries. Let's see how far I get this year...

## Running

These are written in Go. So you'll need that. Then the code for each part and day are found in `cmd/`, followed by the day, follow by `part1` or `part2`. Once in one of those directories:

```bash
go run .
```
